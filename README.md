# python_blockchain_app

A simple tutorial for developing a blockchain application from scratch in Python.

## What is blockchain? How it is implemented? And how it works?

Please read the [step-by-step implementation tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-develop-blockchain-app-in-python/index.html) to get your answers :)

## Instructions to run

Clone the project,

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app.git
```

Install the dependencies,

```sh
$ cd python_blockchain_app
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start a blockchain node server,

```sh
$ export FLASK_APP=node_server.py
$ flask run --port 8000
```

One instance of our blockchain node is now up and running at port 8000.


Run the application on a different terminal session,

```sh
$ python run_app.py
```

The application should be up and running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
